Point cloud is a kind of data which is tough to process because of its Non-Euclidean structure. Much research have shown that graph convolution is a very suitable model for point cloud analysis including point cloud segmentation, point cloud classification and so on. In this paper, we propose a novel dilated convolution graph convolution model with residual blocks. With hierarchical dilated convolution, our method can expand receptive field without losing the point near the boundary of the receptive field. Our model performs well in many point cloud analysis tasks. The accuracy rates of 93.2$\%$, 57.1$\%$ and 85.4$\%$ were obtained on ModelNet40, S3DIS and ShapeNet datasets respectively. In addition, we made a point cloud grasping dataset, and the experiment shows that our model is also applicable to  point cloud application.
